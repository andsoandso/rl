""" 
Agent learns values and policies from errors.  We'll call this ethics. 

If he is good he gets more rewards.

Values and policies intersect right and wrong leading to errors.

In space, right and wrong rest in one state or some other.  
 
Spaces don't exist till Agent arrives.  Next!

Agent lives in Markov's world.  He is dumb.  He can almost never
remember any history.

When told to run, he runs.  But you have to tell him for how long.
